  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>PocketDocs</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses
    and protects your information when you use the PocketDocs mobile application and related
    services (the “App”).
  </p>

  </p>

  <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
  <p>We may collect and process the following categories of information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account information</strong> – your name, email address and profile photo
      when you sign in with Google or Facebook.</li>
    <li><strong>Basic profile details</strong> – information you provide during onboarding,
      such as your name, gender, date of birth, interests and personal targets/goals.</li>
    <li><strong>App usage data</strong> – technical information such as device type,
      operating system, language, and in-app actions (e.g. which screens are opened),
      collected in an anonymised or aggregated form.</li>
    <li><strong>Communication data</strong> – messages you choose to send us (for example,
      when contacting support).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How we collect your information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Directly from you when you create an account, complete onboarding forms,
      or interact with the App.</li>
    <li>Via authentication providers (Google, Facebook) when you log in using those
      services.</li>
    <li>From Firebase and Google Analytics tools that help us understand how the App
      is used.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. How we use your information</h2>
  <p>We use your data to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create and manage your PocketDocs account.</li>
    <li>Remember your onboarding information (interests, goals, etc.) so the app can
      personalize your experience.</li>
    <li>Provide, maintain and improve the App and its features.</li>
    <li>Secure the App, prevent abuse and detect technical issues.</li>
    <li>Communicate with you about important updates or changes to the App.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Legal bases for processing</h2>
  <p>We process your personal data based on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contract</strong> – to provide the services you install and use.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> – to improve the App and keep it secure.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent</strong> – where required for certain optional features. You can
      withdraw consent at any time by contacting us.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Third-party services</h2>
  <p>
    PocketDocs uses trusted third-party services for authentication, storage and analytics.
    These include, but may not be limited to:

    These services may process your data in accordance with their own privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Data storage & retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your account data is stored in Google Firebase (for example, in Firestore and
      Firebase Authentication).</li>
    <li>We keep your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide
      the service.</li>
    <li>If you request deletion of your account, we will delete or anonymise your
      personal data within a reasonable time, unless we are required to keep it for
      legal reasons.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Data security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data
    (such as encrypted connections and secure authentication). However, no online service
    can be completely secure and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>
