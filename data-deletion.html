  <h1>PocketDocs – User Data Deletion</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: 28 November 2025</p>

  <p>
    This page explains how you can request deletion of your PocketDocs account and related
    personal data (including data collected via Google Login or Facebook Login).
  </p>

  <h2>1. Delete your account from inside the app (when available)</h2>
  <p>
    In future versions of the PocketDocs app there will be an in-app option to delete
    your account and data. When this feature is available, you will be able to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Open the PocketDocs app.</li>
    <li>Go to <strong>Settings → Account → Delete account</strong>.</li>
    <li>Confirm that you want to permanently delete your account and data.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    After confirming, your account and associated personal data stored in Firebase
    (such as your profile and onboarding information) will be deleted or anonymised
    within a reasonable time.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Request deletion by email</h2>
  <p>
    If you cannot access the app or if the in-app delete option is not available on
    your device, you can request deletion by contacting us directly.
  </p>

  <p>Please send an email to:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="mailto:pocketdocs0@gmail.com">pocketdocs0@gmail.com</a>
  </p>

  <p>Include the following information in your email:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The subject line: <strong>“PocketDocs – Delete my account”</strong>.</li>
    <li>The email address you used to log in to PocketDocs
      (Google or Facebook account email).</li>
    <li>Optional: any additional information that helps us identify your account
      (for example, the name shown in the app).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We will verify your request and delete or anonymise your personal data stored
    in our systems (Firebase Authentication, Firestore, etc.) within a reasonable
    timeframe, usually within 30 days, unless we are required to keep certain data
    for legal or security reasons.
  </p>

  <h2>3. What data will be deleted</h2>
  <p>
    When your account is deleted, we aim to remove the following types of data:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your authentication record (Google/Facebook login) in Firebase Authentication.</li>
    <li>Your user profile document in Firestore (name, email, onboarding information,
      interests, targets and similar fields stored by the app).</li>
    <li>Any other personal information that can reasonably be linked to your account.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Some aggregated or anonymised usage statistics may be kept for analytics and
    service improvement, but these will no longer be linked to you personally.
  </p>
